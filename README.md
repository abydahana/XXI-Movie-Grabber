# XXI Movie Grabber
This repository is the source code for the **NoAd! Streaming** project that has been shut down. This project is for the experimental purpose only. All credits will be refered and belongs to the original source file creator.

Code first written for the **Smart TV** or **Android TV** with remote control functionality. All syntax were clean to learn and easy customized for the future changes. No such special library, only the **cURL** execution with the **regular expression** adjustment. Kindly check periodically for the source server changes and assign the regular expression to follow the newest results.

# Installation
Upload whole files to your server, make the "**subtitles**" folder to be writable. The subtitle file for the movie will be downloaded automatically and will be skipped for the next request for the same movie. Subtitle's downloaded from **subscene.com**, which have the highest rating. The default subtitle is in "**indonesian**", change the config from the `/apis/includes/subscene.php`

# Notes
The subtitle may not synchronized with the video playback. Use your feeling to build the subtitle synchronization function.
No file were saved to the local server expect subtitle (**VTT format**).

# Bounty?
Of course. You may the developer from the original source (**IndoXXI**). I much appreciated your works but as you see there, your system isn't that strong. I'm available for contact, to share the method i used to guess your "**secure**" logic. **Google my name**.
